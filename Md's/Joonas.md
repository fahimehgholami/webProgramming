We have decided to create our own branches. Everyone has their own branch under their name. This will help us not to have conflicts with the main branch that will be published.

My feature plans:

In our static website, I made a carousel section. In the carousel as the slide I asked the users to tip us and share their favourite place in Hämeenlinna for us to publish it on the website.

How to apply this:

Build a <form> beneath the carousel section that asks the user:

<li> - Name of the place
<li> - Synopsis of the place
<li> - Possible link to the website, if available
<li> - Possibly share a photo/link to the photo for us to use.

For the db:

<li> - tabel consistng of:
<li> - place/location VARCHAR
<li> - id????? - synopsis VARCHAR
<li> - link VARCHAR
<li> - photo TBD or URL VARCHAR

JS:

<li> - Make a function something to do with this 
<li> - need more ideas for this
