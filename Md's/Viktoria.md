TEAM 3: 

My plugin idea would be a "newsletter" option for the website users, which would provide more useful imformation about HÃ¤meenlinna and reasons for why they should visit the city. 

The plugin would either be in the footer or in the navigation bar. When clicked, the link would lead the user to a seperate php file, with a form, where and their first name, last name and email address can be added. The email address would be contained in a table called "newsletter" within the team's database. 

As an extra option, on the form, there would be another button, which gives them the opportunity to "unsubscribe" from the newsletter, by typing their name and email address again. This way their info can be deleted from the database table.
